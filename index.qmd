# Welcome!

Computational skills are essential in the modern research environment,
which increasingly involves large datasets and high performance
computing, along with increasing demand that scientific studies be
reproducible and open. With these modern demands, researchers across
nearly all disciplines often need to create, use, and share software.
Most introductions to programming or software engineering focus on
developing commercial applications, however, researchers needs are
largely related to exploring problems and answering questions. This book
covers the fundamentals of creating software as part of your research
cycle whether you work alone or as part of a team.

We wrote this book with three audiences in mind:

1.  **Learners in a class setting** who would be using this book in a
    more formal class or workshop setting, lead by an instructor or
    instructors. Much of the book is written with this reader in mind.
2.  **Independent learners** who would be going through the material and
    learning on their own. An independent learner can for the most part
    follow the book as if they were a learner in a class setting, with
    some modifications that we highlight and describe where necessary.
3.  **Instructors** who would use this book as the basis for a course or
    workshop of their own. Throughout the book there are sections
    dedicated to this reader that give information or instructions on
    how to use or modify the material for the instructor's specific
    context. See Appendix @sec-for-instructors for more detail about how
    to use this book for teaching.

This course is designed to address these issues in code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), reading activities, and
exercises using real-world datasets. This website contains all of the
material for the course, from reading material to exercises to images.
It is structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order
of appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the course
where code-along sessions follow the material on the website nearly
exactly (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-advanced`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-advanced)
GitHub repository.
